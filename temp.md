Okay, let's take a look at this JavaScript function!

**Feedback:**
‚úÖ The function seems like it's intended to add two numbers, which is great!
‚ö†Ô∏è However, there are a couple of things we need to clarify to make it work correctly.

### What's Wrong?
1.  **Undeclared Variables** ‚Äì The function is trying to use variables `a` and `b`, but these variables haven't been declared or passed as arguments to the function. JavaScript doesn't automatically know what `a` and `b` are!
2.  **Missing Parameters** ‚Äì Functions that need to work with specific values should accept those values as parameters (arguments).

### How to Fix It?
Here's an improved version of the code:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Here's what we changed:

*   **Added Parameters:** `a` and `b` are now parameters of the function. This means that when you call the function, you need to provide values for `a` and `b`.

Now you can use the function like this:

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8
console.log(result);
```

This approach is:

‚úÖ **Clearer** ‚Äì It explicitly shows that the function needs two inputs.
‚úÖ **More Flexible** ‚Äì You can use the function to add any two numbers you want.
‚úÖ **More Robust** ‚Äì It avoids relying on variables that might not be defined.

Feel free to play around with this improved function, try different values, and see how it works! If you have any questions or want to explore other ways to define functions in JavaScript, just ask! üöÄ
